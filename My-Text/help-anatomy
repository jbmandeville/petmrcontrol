1) Set the subject ID. This generally is a short ID used to de-identify subjects.

2) Make sure the subject directory is correct, as well as the file name (raw.nii).

3) Run FreeSurfer. This will generally take a workday or an overnight.

4) When Freesurfer is done, an extracted brain will be placed on the anatomy directory.
   This should be selected automatically as the file name (brain.nii). Now perform alignment.
   This step will bring up FastMap. Click the CALCULATOR button to peform affine alignment.
   When fastmap is done with the auto-alignment process, remember to

   a) Click the "running man" button in fastmap to replace the original file with the
      transformed file in program memory. This DOES NOT SAVE the file.

   b) Click the "save" button to save the file (align.nii) to the anatomy directory.

   c) Quit fastmap to get back to this program.

Note that the file name will change from "raw.nii" to "brain.nii" after running freeSurfer,
and then change from "brain.nii" to "align.nii" after running the alignment step.
The processing functions are enabled or disabled according to the selected file.
For instance, alignment is disabled once a file named "align.nii" has been created
on the anatomy directory.  To check alignment and potentially change affine values,
change the file name back to "brain.nii" to enable the alignment function.
