1) Set the subject ID. This generally is a short ID used to de-identify subjects.

2) Make sure the subject directory is correct, as well as the file name (raw.nii).

3) Run FreeSurfer. This will generally take a day or a night.

4) When Freesurfer is done, an extracted brain will be placed on the anatomy directory.
   This should be selected automatically as the file name (brain.nii). Now perform alignment.
   This step will bring up FastMap. Click the calculator button to peform affine alignment.
   When it is done, remember to

   a) Click the "running man" button to replace the original file with the transformed file
      in program memory.

   b) Click the "save" button to save the file (align.nii) to the anatomy directory.
