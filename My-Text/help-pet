To create the PET time series, first

1) create the pseudo-muMap on Aether (see "help" on download page)
2) tranfer the pseudo-muMap to Bay 7 (replace the MRAC-based mu map DICOM series)
3) run "PET Retro-recon" on Bay 7
4) push the data to Bourget, and then download it using this program (from download page).

This analysis pipeline uses the EPI volumes to motion-correct the PET data.
With the correct PET time-series selected, make sure that all PET frames have at least
a few EPI volumes that fall into the time bins. The motion-correction procedure is
   a) Average all EPI volumes that fall into a time bin, and reslice the average volume
      to match the PET geometry. This will create an EPI series matched to the PET series.
   b) Use AFNI to correct the motion in the EPI series.
   c) Apply the motion correction parameters to the PET series using AFNI

Alignment simply takes the anatomical (T1) alignment parameters and applies this to the PET frames.
No interaction is required. Remember to set the post-alignment smoothing width before proceeding.
