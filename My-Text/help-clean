Cleaning:
This page gives the option of cleaning files. Once things are downloaded,
the DICOMs are used anymore, so those can go. If you remove raw.nii files,
another download will be required to retrieve them. The advantage of keeping
motion-corrected files (mc.nii) is that alignment can be refined, or changes
in smoothing can be tested, starting with those files.
